# Access
Create a user account for each ontology portal:
 - Earth Science Ontology Portal (ESIP Portal): http://semanticportal.esipfed.org/
 - ESIP Community Ontology Repository (COR): http://cor.esipfed.org/ont#/
# API Access
Portions of this evaluation ask you to access the ESIP Portal and COR via their respective Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Both the ESIP Portal and COR have API authorization requirements you should be aware of.
## ESIP Portal
The ESIP Portal uses a so-called API key, which is a unique identifier that tells the Portal who is making the request. Only individuals with valid Portal accounts are permitted to make API calls.
### Getting an API key
Use of the Portal REST API requires an API key.
 - To retrieve your API key, log into your account. Your API key will be listed in plain text on your account page.
### Using your API key
The ESIP Portal is based off of BioPortal and the BioPortal API documentation can be referenced during API access: [data.bioontology.org/documentation](data.bioontology.org/documentation).
## COR
 - COR has a similar process with documentation available at: cor.esipfed.org/ontapi/
# Instructions
1. Familiarize yourself with each portal. Consider each from your own user perspective before assuming the user profiles associated with each of the four use cases. 
2. Read through each component of the use case: User Profile, Scenario, Workflow and Requirements.
3. Work through each use case twice: once using the ESIP Portal and once using the COR. 
4. For each use case, and for each portal, make note of the following as you complete your review: 
    1. Ability to complete each task in the workflow.
    2. For each use case, rate the portal’s: 
        - Usability;
        - Quality and clarity of documentation.
    3. Please describe your impressions for each of the following:
        - Ontology Ingest capability; 
        - Portal access;
        - Quality and usability of the portal’s display;
        - Search-capabilities;
        - Errors, 
        - API support;
        - Maintainability; 
        - Overall impression.
