# Overview
Two separate ontology portals have been built by members of the [ESIP Semantic Technologies Committee (STC)](http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/Semantic_Technologies). It is the goal of this evaluation to review both and provide ESIP leadership with a recommendation on the potential direction of supporting an ontology portal in the future.  

To do this, the STC has created a set of four use cases that describe current problems or future opportunities for semantic resources within the ESIP community. Each use case is related to one or more of the deliverables from the committee’s [2015-2020 Strategic Plan Goals](http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/Semantic_Technologies#2015-2020_Strategic_Plan_Goals). 

Evaluators will use the two ontology portals to work though each use case; find use cases and detailed evaluation instructions are here.  

# Evaluation Details
Before you accept or decline an invitation to evaluate, consider the following questions:
 - Does this match your area of expertise? Only accept if you feel you can provide a high quality review.
 - Do you have a potential conflict of interest? Disclose this to the evaluation coordinator when you respond.
 - Do you have time? Reviewing can be a lot of work – before you commit, make sure you can meet the deadline.

Respond to the invitation as soon as you can – delay in your decision slows down the evaluation process, whether you agree to review or not. If you decline the invitation, provide suggestions for alternative evaluators.

## Your review report
Your review will provide valuable feedback to portal developers and ESIP leadership. Giving your overall opinion and general observations of each portal is essential. Your comments should be courteous and constructive, and should not include any personal remarks or personal details including your name.

Providing insight into any deficiencies is also important. You should explain and support your judgement so that both ESIP leadership and the portal developers are able to fully understand the reasoning behind your comments. You should indicate whether your comments are your own opinion or are reflected by the portal’s performance. You should submit your final report to the ESIP Lab Director (annieburgess@esipfed.org).

## Report checklist
Summarize each portal in a short paragraph. 
Give your main impressions of each portal, including whether it has a sufficient impact and adds to the knowledge base.
Give specific comments and suggestions related to components listed in the Instructions Document. 
Your recommendation.

## Your recommendation
Please provide any final insights about the prospect of ESIP hosting on of the reviewed ontology portals and the potential benefit to the Earth sciences community. 

## Privacy
It is our policy that we treat your recommendation as confidential, meaning only between ESIP staff. This means ESIP will not include your name on your final report with anyone else without prior authorization. As such, we also ask that you do not share your evaluation with others without prior consent by ESIP.
