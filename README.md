# STCEvaluation
This is the documentation for the evaluation of two ontology portals developed within ESIP. 

# Evaluation Goals
The goal of the evaluation process is to ultimatly have a semantic resource for the Earth sciences that can build upon by the community.

## Semantic Technologies Committee goals: 

- Evaluation should result in a production-quality resource for the community.
- Evaluation should clarify maintenance-requirements of an ESIP-supported portal.
- Evaluation should clarify terms of service for the supported portal.

## Portal developer goals: 
- Understand what it means for ESIP to support infrastructure.
- A clear decision on which (or both) portal ESIP will support.
- Increases use/awareness by the community of the utility of systems like this.
- Improve portal technology.
